## How to use

## Requirements
- Having `pipx` installed in the system is strongly suggested. If it is not an option check the [official documentation](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) for alternatives.

## Installation

```
pipx install copier
```


## TODOs:

- [ ] Add super quick configuration as default with an option to do the current advanced one. Just prompt for the project name and set the defaults for everything else.
- [ ] Configure email backend
- [ ] add support for docker image creation (if possible):
    - dynamic entrypoint
    - supervisor conf
    - nginx conf
    - dockerfile
